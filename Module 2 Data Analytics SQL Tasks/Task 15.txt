Write An SQL Query To Solve The Given Problem Statement.

List the top 5 recruitment channels with the highest average length of service for employees who have met more than 80% of their KPIs, have a previous_year_rating of 5, and an age between 25 and 45 years, grouped by department and recruitment channel. ( Round average length up to two decimal places if needed).

SELECT department, recruitment_channel, ROUND(AVG(length_of_service), 2) AS avg_length_of_service
FROM employee
WHERE KPIs_met_more_than_80 = 1
  AND previous_year_rating = 5
  AND age BETWEEN 25 AND 45
GROUP BY department, recruitment_channel
ORDER BY AVG(length_of_service) DESC
LIMIT 5;
